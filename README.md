# Spotify and Exam Day Analysis

## Overview
This project is part of the Sabancı University - DSA210 Introduction to Data Science course. It explores the relationship between music listening habits and exam days by analyzing two datasets:

1. **Spotify Listening Data** (from September 2023 to June 2025)  
2. **Exam Day Records** (covering the same period)

## Project Motivation
As someone who listens to music regularly, I’ve always wondered how my listening habits change during stressful periods, such as exam days. This project aims to uncover patterns in my music choices, listening times, and durations during these specific periods. The analysis seeks to provide insights into whether my music consumption adapts to different levels of focus and stress during exam days.

## Data Description
This analysis utilizes two separate datasets:

### Spotify Data
- **Timeframe:** From September 2023 to June 2025  
- **Key Attributes:**
  - Songs listened to (titles and artists)
  - Listening duration
  - Timestamps of playback
  - Associated genres

### Exam Day Data
- **Timeframe:** Covers the same period.  
- **Key Attributes:**
  - Exam dates
  - Exam start and end times
  - Related course or subject name

## Goals and Next Steps

### 1. **Initial Analysis**
   - Conduct a thorough exploration of Spotify data to identify overall listening habits, including peak listening times, preferred genres, and any notable changes on exam days.
   - Analyze exam day data to pinpoint recurring patterns in scheduling and duration.

### 2. **Understanding Connections**
   - Investigate potential links between changes in music listening habits (e.g., genres, times, and durations) and exam schedules.
   - Explore whether specific music patterns are more common during pre-exam or post-exam periods.

### 3. **Modeling and Insights**
   - Use clustering techniques to group similar music listening behaviors around exam days.
   - Highlight patterns and trends in music consumption during high-focus periods.

### 4. **Reporting and Visualization**
   - Create detailed visualizations and summaries of the analysis.
   - Provide practical insights on music listening habits based on the findings.
